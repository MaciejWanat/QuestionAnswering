# Question Answering

This is my project for Natural Language Processing which takes questions about people in natural language and looks for answers in dbpedia.
It uses quepy and NLTK.
Implemented in python.
Works in English language.

- main.py - main code
- dbpedia - contains regexes for processing in quepy
